# Webshop 
##### _(sept-oct 2016)_
### **<ins>disclaimer: not an actual webshop, just a fa√ßade.</ins>**
This is the first proper HTML page that i coded. 
I have made this for middle school/ high school (it translates poorly into english).

For this project i was supposed to make a website with a classmate, and we desided i'd do the backend and he the frontend.
We were quite unrestricted in what we could do, so we decided on a computer vendor / webshop.


### Some things to note
* Because of privacy reasons i had to remove my classmate's name and phone.
* If i'd redo the code now it'd be like 1/8 the size.
* there was a planned functionality with PHP, apache and MySQL.
But this was scrapped half way and there could still be remnants of that code.
* The logo, colour palette, layout and images are all __not__ made by me.
* The images are from google, the other stuff by my classmate. All i did was the HTML/CSS.

Now i'll briefly explain the pages
# Site navigation
## Home

Just the homepage that explained the website, i removed alot of personal info from it for privacy reasons.
i guess here i'll explain the navbar too,
* Home = Home
* Producten = Products
* Winkelwagen = Shopping cart
* Over Ons/Contact = About us/Contact (deleted for privacy)
## Products

Ouch, the code is painful on this page. Here you could "order" whatever was listed. the *voeg toe aan winkelwagen* was supposed to add it to your cart, but the PHP was scrapped so that doesn't work.
## Shopping cart

Well, it isn't a working shopping cart but it was supposed to be a placeholder page.
This is a multi part page, the first prompt asks you if you want to continue shopping [YES] / [NO]

Second prompt; Do you want to checkout? [I want to continue shopping] / [I want to checkout]
![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/892668729241002024/951035583814311988/unknown.png)

Third prompt; How do you want to checkout? [Ideal] / [Paypal]
### IDeal

For IDeal you get prompted with a selection menu of which bank to use, they don't do anything and some options might be fake banks.

### Paypal

For paypal you get prompted to fill in a [USERNAME] and [PASSWORD], it doesn't do anything though.
clicking [complete] will send you to the loading page.
